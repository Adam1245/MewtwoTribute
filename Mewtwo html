    <li><strong> So, this is my power... but what is my purpose?
      </li>
      <br></br>
    <li><strong>
      So I am simply the end result of your experiment. What becomes of me now that your experiment is over?
Scientist: Oh our experiment isn't over yet, it's just beginning. Now the serious testing begins! </li>
      <br></br>
  <li><strong>
    “I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.” </li>
    <br></br>
  <li><strong> Enough! We are what we are. We will stay here and live in peace, if we can.</li>
    <br></br>
  <li><strong>There is nothing to be gained from such battling. You are the same as the other Pokèmon. Neither stronger nor weaker. You proved that the last time we met.</li>
    <br></br>
<li><strong> I searched for a place to live in secret and in peace. Now these humans have found us again. Perhaps we shall never find peace.</li>
  <br></br>
<li><strong> You will not defile this place. It does not belong to you, anymore than I do. This place has given me new life. Now I shall use all of my power to defend it.</li>
